Support SLA is there to guarantee minimum disruption to customers deployments and to provide correct urgency to priority requests.

Hence as support engineers we **must** always honor the SLA at all times.

Please be thoroughly familiar with following in the support policy,

- Support Ticket Types
- Service Levels
- Severity Levels

Please refer the online [Support Policy](https://wso2.com/licenses/support-policy/5.4/) documentation.
