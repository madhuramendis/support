## SLA is now

- Need to resolve all issues NOW.
- Do not pre book issues. Pick it up if you can work on it now.
- Leave no open, Re-opened or Waiting On WSO2 behind.
- Turn around time is a key concern for the customer. Sooner you can get back to the customer better.

## Strive to resolve

- Walk the extra mile to find the correct solution and resolve the issue.
- Cannot reproduce is NOT an answer.
  - Did you setup right?
  - Applied all patches/ using the same WUM update level as customer?
  - Did you run standalone or did you do a distributed setup?
  - Did you implement a sample?
- Request Information only if it is absolutely necessary
  - Check details in CIP
  - Previous tickets
  - Emails
  - If you do ask, request all information in one go
  - Reason out and explain why we are requesting the particular information. (in order to verify what?)
- Do not ask unwanted questions
-  Make assumptions, verify them and state them clearly.
- Cut back on bouncing factor. Do not pass it back to customer.

## Keep the customer informed

- Be as informative as possible.
  - What you have done
  - What worked and what did not
  - What the next steps/plans are
  - What the ETA for a solution
- Must update the customer end of the day unless we have already provided an ETA
- If something is time consuming provide an ETA and inform the customer

## Report all time

- Because time is money
- Any time that you spent adding value to help resolve a ticket is support time.
- We no longer want you to report learning time. All time not reported is assumed to be learning time.
- Be informed about time reporting guidelines.
- Ask for support leadership when in doubt.

## Own tickets for life time

- Check &quot;assigned to me&quot; issues daily.
- Because context helps a lot when solving an issue. Switching to someone else loses context and takes time. So check your Reopen, WOW issues.

## Escalate if stuck

- It is ok to ask for help. It is not ok to have stagnant issues.
- Escalation paths
  - Support lead
  - Support chat
  - Support-dev mailing list
  - Support leadership
  - Product leads
