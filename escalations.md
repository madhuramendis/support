## Customer Escalations

- Customers will escalate issues when they see delays in replying to tickets and for urgent issues.
- They will use support system to do so by increasing severity of the issue or opening an incident. Also they could escalate this to Account Manager where its then raised to support.
- All these escalations will be recorded and managed through the [CIP Escalation view](https://identity-internal-gateway.cloud.wso2.com/t/wso2internal928/wso2cip/perspective/escalations).

## Internal Escalations

Support-dev mailing list is used to discuss any matter related to support JIRA and support activities.

Please follow this procedure when you are opening a mail thread relating to a JIRA.

1. Search your mailbox using the JIRA ID (i.e. SEAGATEDEV-24), you will find a mail generated from JIRA to support-jira-alerts@wso2.com. Use this mail to conduct any discussions related to the particular JIRA.
2. Click the forward button in jira notification mail.
3. Edit existing subject and compose mail. You may edit its subject and remove &#39;[WSO2 Support] : &#39; part so the discussion will not be overlapped with JIRA updates.

## Points to note: 

- Product teams are the core contact for any product related information. In situations where you see a delay in replies to the mail thread, the best option is to talk in person and clarify.
- Please keep the thread active until a correct solution is carved. Ping the thread and follow-up if the discussion appears abandoned without a resolution.
- As a practice please contribute to the emails on support dev;
  - Respond to others
  - Do it in hours, not in days time
